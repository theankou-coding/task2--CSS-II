Bootstrap Framework Overview

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides developers with a set of tools and components for building responsive and mobile-first web applications. It simplifies the process of creating responsive web designs by offering a grid system, pre-defined CSS classes, and JavaScript components, allowing developers to focus on the design and functionality of their applications without having to write extensive custom styles.

Benefits of Using Bootstrap for Responsive Web Design
Responsive Grid System: Bootstrapâ€™s grid system is based on a 12-column layout, allowing you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
Predefined CSS Classes: Bootstrap provides numerous utility classes that streamline styling for common components like buttons, forms, and navigation bars.
Customizable: Bootstrap can be customized to fit the design needs of a project, whether through its Sass variables or by overriding styles.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: It ensures consistent styling across various browsers and devices.
